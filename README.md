# Theater Seating Challenge

In this project, I use create an algorithm utilizing binary search in order to seat movie watchers at a theater (with COVID-19 protocols).

# Requirements:

It is integral that developers use python 3.8 in order to run main.py

# COVID-19 Protocols

Due to the ongoing pandemic, movie theaters have restrictions. Rather than having a capacity, this algorithm assumes that parties be seperated by at least three empty seats and/or an entire row.

# The Process

The user starts execution of the program by running $python main.py$
