# Theater Seating Challenge

In this project, I use create an algorithm utilizing binary search in order to seat movie watchers at a theater (with COVID-19 protocols).

# Requirements:

Python 3.8

# COVID-19 Protocols

Due to the ongoing pandemic, movie theaters have restrictions. Rather than having a capacity, this algorithm assumes that parties be seperated by at least three empty seats and/or an entire row.

# The Process

The user starts execution of the program by running `python main.py`, in which they will immediately be prompted with a command asking them to enter the relative path in which to read the input .txt file from. If the path is valid, the program will create an output file and will return the relative path to the output file on the command line.
